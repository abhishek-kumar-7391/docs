      <h2>Answer</h2>
      <p>Optical fibres rely on a process of total internal reflection of the ‘light’ that represents the data stream. This means that
        no residual electrical signal is available under normal circumstances, but coupling into a fibre can be achieved for legitimate
        purpose by bending the fibre so that the angle of ‘rays’ inside it no longer conforms to the conditions for total internal
        reflection. A portion of the fibre protective cladding would need to be removed to allow access to the data stream. This would
        be a delicate operation for an attacker to perform and without suitable equipment the likely outcome would be a fractured
        fibre.
