The first four registers (EAX, ECX, EDX, and EBX) are known as general-
purpose registers. These are called the Accumulator, Counter, Data, and Base
registers, respectively. They are used for a variety of purposes, but they mainly
act as temporary variables for the CPU when it is executing machine
instructions.

The second four registers (ESP, EBP, ESI, and EDI) are also general-
purpose registers, but they are sometimes known as pointers and indexes.
These stand for Stack Pointer, Base Pointer, Source Index, and Destination Index,
respectively. The first two registers are called pointers because they store 32-bit
addresses, which essentially point to that location in memory. These registers
are fairly important to program execution and memory management
