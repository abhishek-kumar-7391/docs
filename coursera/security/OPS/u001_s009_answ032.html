      <h2>Answer</h2>
      <p>Firewall asymmetry could complement the different levels of risk relating to incoming and outgoing traffic on the protected
        network. For example, user-friendly outgoing services could be maintained to hosts behind the firewall by allowing circuit
        level functionality on outbound traffic. This is appropriate where internal usersâ€™ requests are relatively trustworthy. By
        contrast, inbound traffic could be subjected to the full scrutiny of application level content. Application level examination
        of traffic involves a considerable processing overhead, but this would be performed on incoming traffic only.
