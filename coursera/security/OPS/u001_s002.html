      <div class="section" id="sec002_001">
        <h2>2.1 Introduction</h2>
        <p>An effective security strategy will of necessity include highly technical features. However, security must begin with more
          mundane considerations which are often disregarded: for example, restricting physical access to buildings, rooms, computer
          workstations, and taking account of the ‘messy’ aspects of human behaviour, which may render any security measures ineffective.
          I shall remind you of these issues at appropriate points in the unit.
        </p>
        <p>The need for security in communication networks is not new. In the late nineteenth century an American undertaker named Almon
          Strowger (<a href="#fig001">Figure 1</a>) discovered that he was losing business to his rivals because telephone operators, responsible for the manual connection
          of call requests, were unfairly diverting calls from the newly bereaved to his competitors. Strowger developed switching systems
          that led to the introduction of the first automated telephone exchanges in 1897. This enabled users to make their own connections
          using rotary dialling to signal the required destination.

        <h2>2.2 The importance of effective network security strategies</h2>
        <p>In more recent years, security needs have intensified. Data communications and e-commerce are reshaping business practices
          and introducing new threats to corporate activity. National defence is also vulnerable as national infrastructure systems,
          for example transport and energy distribution, could be the target of terrorists or, in times of war, enemy nation states.
        </p>
        <p>On a less dramatic note, reasons why organisations need to devise effective network security strategies include the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Security breaches can be very expensive in terms of business disruption and the financial losses that may result.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Increasing volumes of sensitive information are transferred across the internet or intranets connected to it.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Networks that make use of internet links are becoming more popular because they are cheaper than dedicated leased lines. This,
              however, involves different users sharing internet links to transport their data.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Directors of business organisations are increasingly required to provide effective information security.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>For an organisation to achieve the level of security that is appropriate and at a cost that is acceptable, it must carry out
          a detailed risk assessment to determine the nature and extent of existing and potential threats. Countermeasures to the perceived
          threats must balance the degree of security to be achieved with their acceptability to system users and the value of the data
          systems to be protected.

            </h3>
          </div>
          <div class="box_body">
            <p>There are many standards relating to how security systems should be implemented, particularly in data communication networks,
              but it is impractical to identify them all here. A visit to the British Standards Institution website (<a href="http://www.bsigroup.com/">http://www.bsigroup.com/</a>) is a suitable point of reference.
            </p>
            <p>ISO/IEC 17799 (2000) <em>Information Technology – Code of Practice for Information Security Management</em> sets out the management responsibility for developing an appropriate security policy and the regular auditing of systems.
              BS 7799–2 (2002) <em>Information Security Management Systems – Specification with Guidance for Use</em> gives a standard specification for building, operating, maintaining and improving an information security management system,
              and offers certification of organisations that conform. Directors of UK businesses should report their security strategy in
              annual reports to shareholders and the stock market; lack of a strategy or one that is ineffective is likely to reduce the
              business share value.
            </p>
            <p>Organisations in the UK must conform to the Data Protection Act of 1998. This requires that information about people, whether
              it is stored in computer memory or in paper systems, is accurate and protected from misuse and also open to legitimate inspection.

        <h2>2.3 Network security when using your computer</h2>
        <p>Before considering the more technical aspects of network security I shall recount what happens when I switch my computer on
          each morning at The Open University. I hope you will compare this with what happens when you use a computer, and relate it
          to the issues discussed in this unit.
        </p>
        <p>After pressing the start button on my PC, certain elements of the operating system load before I am asked to enter a password.
          This was set by the IT administrators before I took delivery of my PC. The Microsoft Windows environment then starts to load
          and I am requested to enter another password to enable me to access the Open University's network. Occasionally I am told
          that the password will expire in a few days and that I shall need to replace it with another one. A further password is then
          requested because I have chosen to restrict access to the files on my machine, although this is optional. While I am waiting
          I see a message telling me that system policies are being loaded. These policies in my workplace are mainly concerned with
          providing standard configurations of services and software, but could be used to set appropriate access privileges and specify
          how I might use the services. Sometimes the anti-virus software begins an automatic update on my machine to counter new threats
          that have recently been identified.
        </p>
        <p>I can now start my work on my computer, although if I decide to check my email account, or access some information on the
          Open University intranet, or perhaps seek to purchase a textbook from an online retailer, I may need to enter further user
          names, account details or passwords. This sequence of events is likely to be fairly typical of the requirements of many work
          environments and you will, no doubt, appreciate the profusion of password and account details that can result.
        </p>
        <p>In this short narrative I have omitted an essential, yet easily forgotten, dimension of security that affects access to networks
          – the swipe card on the departmental entrance door and the lock on the door to my room. Although these may be considered mundane
          and unimportant, they are essential aspects of network security and a common oversight when the focus is on more sophisticated
          electronic security measures.
        </p>
        <p>An important criterion, which is generally applicable, is that a system can be considered secure if the cost of illicitly
          obtaining data from it is greater than the intrinsic value of the data. This affects the level of security that should reasonably
          be adopted to protect, for instance, multi-million pound transfers between banks or a student's record at The Open University.
        </p>
        <p>In this unit I shall introduce some of the fundamental concepts that underpin approaches to achieving network security, rather
          than provide you with the knowledge to procure and implement a secure network. The Communications-Electronics Security Group
          is the government's national technical authority for information assurance. If you need to investigate matters relating to
          procurement and implementation, you should refer to its website (<a href="http://www.cesg.gov.uk">http://www.cesg.gov.uk</a>), from which you can find an introduction to the Information Assurance and Certification Service and also the Information
          Technology Security Evaluation and Certification Scheme. The latter scheme enables you to identify products that have undergone
          security evaluation.
        </p>
        <p>In the next section I shall introduce the categories of attacks that can be launched against networks, before discussing appropriate
          countermeasures.
