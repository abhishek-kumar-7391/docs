metamorphic, polymorphic
	basic idea: is to change the program as it executes and keep it doing till it runs
		it makes it hard for the antivirus programs that look for signatures to detect these kind of viruses.

		transformation techniques:
		the following techniques may be used to modify the virus as it runs.
		-> register renaming
		-> code permutation
		-> code expansion
		-> code shrinking
		-> garbage code insertion
		

		techniques required for detection of viruses:
		-> generic decryption scanning.
		-> negative heuristic analysis.
		-> emulation
		-> access to virtualization technolgies.
