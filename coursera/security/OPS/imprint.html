      <p>We believe the primary barrier to accessing high-quality educational experiences is cost, which is why we aim to publish as
        much free content as possible under an open licence. If it proves difficult to release content under our preferred Creative
        Commons licence (e.g. because we can’t afford or gain the clearances or find suitable alternatives), we will still release
        the materials for free under a personal end-user licence. 
      </p>
      <p>This is because the learning experience will always be the same high quality offering and that should always be seen as positive
        – even if at times the licensing is different to Creative Commons. 
      </p>
      <p>When using the content you must attribute us (The Open University) (the OU) and any identified author in accordance with the
        terms of the Creative Commons Licence.

        subject to Creative Commons licensing. Proprietary content must be used (retained) intact and in context to the content at
        all times.
      </p>
      <p>The Acknowledgements section is also used to bring to your attention any other Special Restrictions which may apply to the
        content. For example there may be times when the Creative Commons Non-Commercial Sharealike licence does not apply to any
        of the content even if owned by us (The Open University). In these instances, unless stated otherwise, the content may be
        used for personal and non-commercial use.
