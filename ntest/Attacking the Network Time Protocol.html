<p>Time is a fundamental building block for computing applications, and is heavily utilized by many cryptographic protocols (eg. <a href="https://www.thawte.com/resources/getting-started/ssl-faq/%22">digital certificates and TLS</a>,
 <a href="http://culubas.blogspot.com/2011/05/timejacking-bitcoin_802.html">bitcoin</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_%28protocol%29">authentication with Kerberos</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions">DNSSEC</a>, etc).  Time on computer clocks is commonly set using the Network Time Protocol (<a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5905.txt">NTP</a>).   We have uncovered several security issues affecting unauthenticated NTP and its reference implementation <a href="http://www.ntp.org/downloads.html">ntpd</a>.
  These issues allow an attacker to either (a) alter time on computer 
systems that set their clocks using NTP (timeshifting attacks), or (b) 
prevent those systems from synchronizing their clocks (denial of service
 attacks).

<p>
</p><li><b><a name="a1">Attack 1 (Denial of Service by Spoofed Kiss-o'-Death).</a></b><a name="a1">
 We present an attack that could be used to deactivate NTP on most of 
the computers in the Internet using only a single attacking machine.   
An off-path attacker, located anywhere on the Internet, can exploit 
NTP's rate-limiting mechanism--- the </a><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5905#section-7.4">Kiss-o'-Death (KoD) packet</a>---to
 disable NTP at a victim client.  This attack exploits the fact that 
ntpd versions earlier than 4.2.8p4 allow an off-path attacker to 
trivially spoof a single KoD packet for each of the client's 
preconfigured servers; upon receipt of the spoofed KoD, the client stops
 querying its servers for days or even years,  and can therefore no 
longer update its clock.   Because the attacker need only send a few 
Kiss-o'-Death packets per victim client, standard network scanning tools
 (nmap, zmap) can be adapted to very quickly launch this attack, in 
bulk, on most of the ntpd clients in the Internet. This vulnerability is
 described in <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7704">CVE-2015-7704</a>, and in Section V.A-V.C of our technical paper.

    <p></p></li><li><a name="a2"><b>Attack 2 (Denial of Service by Priming the Pump).</b> Even if the vulnerability that allows KoD packets to be trivially spoofed (see </a><a href="#a1">Attack 1</a>)
 is patched, an off-path attacker can still disable NTP at a victim 
client.  This attack once again exploits rate-limiting via the KoD 
packet.  Here, the attacker <i>elicits</i> a valid KoD packet from the 
client's preconfigured servers by 'priming the pump', i.e., sending the 
servers a high volume of queries that are spoofed to look like they come
 from the client. The servers then start rate-limiting the client, 
responding to each of its subsequent queries with a valid KoD packet. 
Upon receipt of the KoD, the client stops querying its servers, and can 
no longer update its local clock.   This attack has the same effect as <a href="#a1">Attack 1</a>,
 but requires the attacker expend more resources by sending more packets
 to the client's servers.  This vulnerability is described in <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7705">CVE-2015-7705</a> with more details in Section V.B-V.C of our technical paper.

<p>
</p></li><li><b><a name="a3">Attack 3 (Timeshifting by Reboot).</a></b><a name="a3"> We discuss how an on-path attacker that hijacks traffic to an NTP server (using, for example, </a><a href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2668966">BGP</a> or <a href="http://unixwiz.net/techtips/iguide-kaminsky-dns-vuln.html">DNS</a>
 hijacks) can shift time on the server's clients.   Under normal 
conditions, if NTP attempts to update the local clock by a value that 
exceeds the <i>panic threshold</i> (about 16 minutes), then the NTP 
client "SHOULD exit with a diagnostic message to the system log".   We 
discuss how to circumvent the panic threshold by exploiting ntpd's 
behavior upon reboot.      We also present the small-step-big-step 
attack, which allows an attacker that reboots the client to stealthily 
create a big time step and then quickly bring the client's clock back to
 normal; this attack is useful for stealthily flushing a client's cache,
 or to causing a specific cryptographic object to expire.  Our 
small-step-big-step attack is described in <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2015-5300">CVE-2015-5300</a> and Section IV.B of our technical paper.

<p>
</p></li><li><b>Attack 4 (Timeshifting by Fragmentation).</b> We show 
how an off-path attacker can exploit IPv4 packet fragmentation to shift 
time on a client.  We explain why NTP's clock discipline algorithms 
require our attack to craft a stream of self-consistent packets (rather 
than just one packet), and demonstrate its feasibility with a 
proof-of-concept implementation. This attack depends on IPv4 
fragmentation policies at the client and server OS, rather than on 
weakness in ntpd or the NTP protocol. See Section VI of our technical 
paper.
</li></ol>
Our technical paper discuss the implications on these attacks on other 
core Internet protocols (including authentication, caching, TLS 
certificates, bitcoin, DNSSEC, and the RPKI) and  quantifies their 
attack surface using Internet measurements.

  We do not recommend the use of NTP's broadcast mode, unless both the 
broadcast clients and the broadcast server are protected by a firewall.

<b><a name="imp"><font face="Century Gothic" size="3" color="#8B008B">For NTP implementors: How should I patch my NTP implementation?</font></a></b><a name="imp">

</a></p><p><a name="imp">
At the very minimum, you should apply the following simple fix to ensure that your implementation is not vulnerable to </a><a href="#a1">Attack 1</a>, our Denial-of-Service by Spoofed Kiss-o'-Death attack in <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7704">CVE-2015-7704</a>:
 make sure that your client implementation drops KoD packets that do not
 pass 'TEST2' (origin timestamp validation).  This should be a simple 
fix: KoD packets are a special kind of NTP mode 4 packet, and regular 
mode 4 packets are required to pass TEST2; you just need to make sure 
that KoD packets are also required to pass TEST2.  See also Section V.A 
of our technical paper.

</p><p>Section V.G of our technical paper provides various suggestions for implementors that would like to mitigate the risk of <a href="#a2">Attack 2</a>, our Denial-of-Service by Priming-the-Pump attack in <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7705">CVE-2015-7705</a>.  One option is to apply techniques developed for rate-limiting other protocols, e.g., <a href="http://ss.vix.su/%7Evixie/isc-tn-2012-1.txt">Response Rate Limiting (RRL)</a>
 in the DNS; the idea here is to require that when server is 
rate-limiting a client with KoDs, it must still send legitimate 
responses (instead of a KoD) to some random fraction of the client's 
queries. For this to be effective, NTP clients should also limit the 
period
for which they are willing to keep quiet upon receipt of a KoD; not 
querying the server for over days or years upon receipt of a single KoD 
packet is excessive and invites abuse.

</p><p>Section IV.B of our technical paper explains why ntpd is vulnerable to the small-step-big-step attack (<a href="#a3">Attack 3</a>).  To patch this, one should edit <font face="courier">ntp_loopfilter.c</font> to ensure that the <font face="courier">allow_panic</font>
 variable is set to FALSE after the very first clock update upon 
initialization. Implementors can also prevent ntpd clients from putting 
'INIT'  in the reference ID of their NTP packets upon initializing; this
 would make it more difficult for attackers to know when initialization 
is taking place, raising the bar for attacks that exploit reboot.


</p><p>We also suggest that the NTP community take another look at 
authenticating NTP traffic. Traffic from client to server AND from 
server to client should be authenticated.  See Section V.G of our 
technical paper.

</a></p><ol><a name="user">
</a><li><a name="user"><b>Attack 1 and Attack 2 (Denial of Service).</b> Upgrade to </a><a href="http://www.ntp.org/">ntpd v4.2.8p4</a>.  To see what ntpd version you are running, log into to your NTP server and type <font face="courier">ntpq</font> and then <font face="courier">rv</font>.   Also, monitor the system log for error messages of the form <i>"receive: Unexpected origin timestamp from %s"</i>, which could indicate that you are subject to a priming-the-pump attack. <!--NTPsec has also been patched for <a name="a1">Attack 1</a>.-->

<p>
</p></li><li><b>Attack 3 (Timeshifting by Reboot).</b> Monitor system logs for suspicious panic events or restarts of ntpd. Alternatively, do not run ntpd with the <font face="courier">-g</font> option enabled. (NOTE: most operating systems run ntpd with <font face="courier">-g</font> as the default.)

<p>
</p></li><li><b>Attack 4. (Fragmentation). </b>   Our fragmentation attacks requires an NTP server that runs on an OS that accepts <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_MTU_Discovery">path MTU discovery (PMTU) requests</a> to fragment to a 68-byte MTU.

<p><i>Running an NTP server?</i> Check if it may be vulnerable to our 
fragmentation attack by entering its IP address into NTP Server 
Fragmentation Vulnerability Test
  box below.     Fortunately, many modern OSes, like  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/893066">Windows</a>,
 do not accept accept requests to fragment to a 68-byte MTU by default; 
your NTP server is more likely to be at risk if it runs on an older 
operating system.  If your server is vulnerable, you should change the 
OS configuration to ensure it does not accept requests to fragment to a 
68-byte MTU, or upgrade to more recent version.  For example, on <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt">Linux</a>, make sure that the <font face="courier">min_pmtu</font> parameter is larger than 90, and on <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26505_01/html/E37386/chapter4-21.html%22">Solaris</a>, make sure that the  <font face="courier">ip_pmtu_min</font> parameter is larger than 90.

  <b>NOTE:</b> Our network measurements indicate that servers running on
 SunOS or Linux 2.2.13 are especially vulnerable to our IPv4 
fragmentation attack; if your NTP server is running on one of these 
OSes, we strongly suggest that you upgrade to a newer OS.

</p><p><i>Running an NTP client?</i>  Check if your client is taking time from vulnerable servers. Log into your client, type  <font face="courier">ntpq</font> and then <font face="courier">peers</font>,
 refer to the leftmost column in the output to get a list of the time 
servers used by your client, and test each of these servers by entering 
its IP/hostname in the NTP Server Fragmentation Vulnerability Test box 
below.  (You can also find the list of servers in  <font face="courier">ntp.conf</font>.)  If one of your servers is vulnerable, you can replace it with a <a href="http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Support/SelectingOffsiteNTPServers">different server</a> in <font face="courier">ntp.conf</font>; see <a href="http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Support/ConfiguringNTP#Section_6.10.">here</a>.
