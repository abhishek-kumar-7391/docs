      <h2>3 Threats to communication networks</h2>
      <div class="section" id="sec003_001">
        <h2>3.1 How have network security measures developed over the past fifty years?</h2>
        <p>To start this section it is useful to reflect on the different obstacles that an intruder, intending to eavesdrop on a telephone
          conversation, might face today compared with fifty years ago, before electronic processing as we now know it. I shall consider
          an attack first between a home telephone and its local exchange (of the order of a mile or less), and then beyond the local
          exchange.
        </p>
        <p>Eavesdropping on a telephone conversation has never been technically difficult. In particular, ‘tapping’ the wires of the
          target telephone in the local circuit would have been straightforward fifty years ago, provided that physical access could
          be gained to the wires. In many old films eavesdropping was carried out by an intruder in the basement of an apartment block
          or in a wiring cabinet in the street, using a basic set of equipment that included a pair of crocodile clips making a connection
          to some simple listening equipment. Today, in principle, a similar approach could still be successful over the last mile of
          the telephone distribution system. Much of the technology is still analogue, and signals can be detected by either direct
          contact with the twisted-pair wires or by sensing fields radiating from the transmissions. However, where ADSL (asymmetric
          digital subscriber line) or ISDN (integrated services digital network) services are provided, separating a telephone conversation
          from data traffic would need an ADSL modem or ISDN telephone and the knowledge to connect them correctly. This information
          is commonly available, so should not be a major obstacle in itself.
        </p>
        <p>Beyond the local exchange, signals are combined (multiplexed) for carrying over transmission links, so to eavesdrop on a particular
          telephone message it must be ‘unpicked’ from other multiplexed messages. In the 1950s the multiplexing of analogue voice messages
          relied on the use of different frequency bands (frequency division multiplexing) within a link's available bandwidth, but
          today time division multiplexing is widely employed to accommodate a mix of digitised voice and data traffic. In digital networks,
          greater difficulty may be experienced in identifying or selecting individual channels. However, agencies with an interest
          in selecting potentially valuable information from a mass of traffic can identify key words that are spoken or written in
          data streams. Digital technology makes it much easier to search for and access data in a structured manner.
        </p>
        <p>Another complication is the coding algorithms that are applied for a variety of purposes, but a determined intruder should
          not find it difficult to reverse these processes, given that many software tools are available from the internet. In fact,
          it is probably the wide availability of tools that can assist intrusion that makes modern networks susceptible, despite their
          use of increasingly sophisticated technology.

        <h2>3.2 Important terminology and information for making the most of this section</h2>
        <p>Before we move on to consider specific issues of network security, I need to introduce some important terms that I shall use
          when describing how data is stored, processed or transmitted to other locations. These are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Confidentiality</strong>, in terms of selecting who or what is allowed access to data and systems. This is achieved through encryption and access
              control systems. Even knowledge of the existence of data, rather than the information that it contains, may be of significant
              value to an eavesdropper.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The <strong>integrity</strong> of data, where modification is allowed only by authorised persons or organisations. The modifications could include any changes
              such as adding to, selectively deleting from, or even changing the status of a set of data.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The <strong>freshness</strong> of data contained in messages. An attacker could capture part or all of a message and re-use it at a later date, passing
              it off as a new message. Some method of incorporating a freshness indicator (e.g. a time stamp) into messages minimises the
              risk of this happening.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The <strong>authentication</strong> of the source of information, often in terms of the identity of a person as well as the physical address of an access point
              to the network such as a workstation.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The <strong>availability</strong> of network services, including security procedures, to authorised people when they are needed.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In general, attacks on data networks can be classified as either passive or active as shown in <a href="#fig002">Figure 2</a>.

        <h2>3.3 Passive attacks</h2>
        <p>A <strong>passive attack</strong> is characterised by the interception of messages without modification. There is no change to the network data or systems.
          The message itself may be read or its occurrence may simply be logged. Identifying the communicating parties and noting the
          duration and frequency of messages can be of significant value in itself. From this knowledge certain deductions or inferences
          may be drawn regarding the likely subject matter, the urgency or the implications of messages being sent. This type of activity
          is termed <strong>traffic analysis</strong>. Because there may be no evidence that an attack has taken place, prevention is a priority.
        </p>
        <p>Traffic analysis, however, may be a legitimate management activity because of the need to collect data showing usage of services,
          for instance. Some interception of traffic may also be considered necessary by governments and law enforcement agencies interested
          in the surveillance of criminal, terrorist and other activities. These agencies may have privileged physical access to sites
          and computer systems.

        <h2>3.4 Active attacks</h2>
        <p>An <strong>active attack</strong> is one in which an unauthorised change of the system is attempted. This could include, for example, the modification of transmitted
          or stored data, or the creation of new data streams. <a href="#fig002">Figure 2</a> (see Section 3.2) shows four sub-categories here: masquerade or fabrication, message replay, message modification and denial
          of service or interruption of availability.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Masquerade attacks</strong>, as the name suggests, relate to an entity (usually a computer or a person) taking on a false identity in order to acquire
          or modify information, and in effect achieve an unwarranted privilege status. Masquerade attacks can also incorporate other
          categories.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Message replay</strong> involves the re-use of captured data at a later time than originally intended in order to repeat some action of benefit to
          the attacker: for example, the capture and replay of an instruction to transfer funds from a bank account into one under the
          control of an attacker. This could be foiled by confirmation of the freshness of a message.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Message modification</strong> could involve modifying a packet header address for the purpose of directing it to an unintended destination or modifying
          the user data.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Denial-of-service attacks</strong> prevent the normal use or management of communication services, and may take the form of either a targeted attack on a particular
          service or a broad, incapacitating attack. For example, a network may be flooded with messages that cause a degradation of
          service or possibly a complete collapse if a server shuts down under abnormal loading. Another example is rapid and repeated
          requests to a web server, which bar legitimate access to others. Denial-of-service attacks are frequently reported for internet-connected
          services.
        </p>
        <p>Because complete prevention of active attacks is unrealistic, a strategy of detection followed by recovery is more appropriate.</p>

        <p>In this unit I shall not deal with the detailed threats arising from computer viruses, but just give a brief explanation of
          some terms. The word ‘virus’ is used collectively to refer to Trojans and worms, as well as more specifically to mean a particular
          type of worm.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>A <strong>Trojan</strong> is a program that has hidden instructions enabling it to carry out a malicious act such as the capture of passwords. These
              could then be used in other forms of attack.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>A <strong>worm</strong> is a program that can replicate itself and create a level of demand for services that cannot be satisfied.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The term <strong>virus</strong> is also used for a worm that replicates by attaching itself to other programs.

        <p>Threats to network security are not static. They evolve as developments in operating systems, application software and communication

            <p>During your study of this unit it would be a good idea to carry out a web search to find the most common forms of network
              attack. A suitable phrase containing key words for searching could be:

              What areas of vulnerability predominate? When I searched in early 2003, the most commonly reported network attacks were attributable
              to weaknesses in software systems (program bugs) and protocol vulnerabilities. Poor discipline in applying passwords rigorously
              and failure to implement other security provision were also cited. Another particular worry was the new opportunities for
              attack created by wireless access to fixed networks.

        <h2>3.5 Potential network vulnerabilities</h2>
        <p>Whatever the form of attack, it is first necessary to gain some form of access to the target network or network component.
          In this section I shall take a brief look at a hypothetical network to see where an attacker may achieve this in the absence
          of appropriate defence measures.
        </p>
        <p><a href="#fig003">Figure 3</a> shows the arrangement of a typical local area network (LAN), in which repeater hubs provide interconnections between workstations
          for a group of users (a work group), with different work groups being interconnected through backbone links and having access
          to the public switched telephone network (PSTN) and a packet-switched network. Repeater hubs are also used to refresh the
          transmitted signal to compensate for the attenuation caused by the transmission medium. I shall use <a href="#fig003">Figure 3</a> to explore the potential for security breaches in a basic network.
        </p>
        <div class="figure-container" id="fig003">
          <div><span><img src="assets/t823_1_003i.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
          <p class="caption"> Figure 3 A typical LAN</p>
        </div>
        <p>Typically, the LAN will be Ethernet based, operating on the broadcast principle, whereby each packet (or strictly frame) is
          presented to all workstations on the local segment, but is normally accepted and read only by the intended receiving station.
          (Segment in this context refers to part of a local area network.) A broadcast environment is advantageous to someone attempting
          to carry out either a passive or an active attack locally. Switches that separate work groups on a LAN incorporate a bridge
          function, and bridges learn where to send packets by noting the source addresses of packets they receive and recording this
          information in a forwarding table. The contents of the forwarding table then determine on which port on the switch packets
          will be sent. An attacker could corrupt entries in forwarding tables by modifying the source address information of incoming
          packets presented to a bridge. Future packets could then be forwarded to inappropriate parts of the network as a result.

        <p>Routers also have forwarding tables that may be vulnerable to attack. However, they are configured in a different way from
          switches and bridges, depending on the security policies applied to the network. In some networks human network managers load
          forwarding tables that may remain relatively unchanged over some time. In larger networks, routing algorithms may update forwarding
          tables automatically to reflect current network conditions. The policy may be to route packets along a least-cost path, where
          the criterion for least cost may be, for example, path length, likely congestion levels or error rate. As routers share information
          they hold with neighbouring routers, any breach of one router's tables could affect several other routers. Any interference
          could compromise the delivery of packets to their intended destination and cause abnormal loading in networks, leading to
          denial of service. Routing tables or policies can be changed legitimately by, for example, network management systems, and
          this highlights the need for the management systems themselves to be protected against manipulation by intruders.
        </p>
        <p>Returning to <a href="#fig003">Figure 3</a>, some organisations need to provide dial-in facilities for employees located away from the workplace. Dial-in access may
          present further opportunities for attack, and measures to protect this vulnerability will need to be considered. A wireless
          access point is also indicated, providing access for several wireless workstations to the wired LAN. Reports of security breaches
          on wireless LANs are widespread at the time of writing (2003), giving rise to the term ‘drive-by hacking’, although many instances
          have occurred quite simply because basic security features have not been activated. As a result, all the attacks on the LAN
          that I have described so far can be performed by someone who does not even have physical access to the site, but could be
          on the street nearby, for example in a parked car.
        </p>
        <p>Some places on a LAN are particularly vulnerable. For example, connections to all internal data and voice communication services
          would be brought together in a wiring cabinet for patching across the various cable runs and for connecting to one or more
          external networks. An intruder would find this a convenient point for tapping into selected circuits or installing eavesdropping
          equipment, so mechanical locks are essential here.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="section" id="sec003_006">
        <h2>3.6 Tapping into transmission media</h2>
        <p>Venturing beyond the organisation's premises in <a href="#fig003">Figure 3</a> (see Section 3.5), there are many opportunities for interception as data passes through external links. These could be cable
          or line-of-sight links such as microwave or satellite. The relative ease or difficulty of achieving a connection to external
          transmission links is worth considering at this point.
        </p>
        <p>Satellite, microwave and wireless transmissions can provide opportunities for passive attack, without much danger of an intruder
          being detected, because the environment at the point of intrusion is virtually unaffected by the eavesdropping activity. Satellite
          transmissions to earth generally have a wide geographic spread with considerable over-spill of the intended reception area.
          Although microwave links use a fairly focused beam of radiated energy, with appropriate technical know-how and some specialist
          equipment it is relatively straightforward physically to access the radiated signals.
        </p>
        <p>I have already mentioned vulnerabilities arising from wireless LANs. In general, detecting and monitoring unencrypted wireless
          transmissions is easy. You may have noticed that when you switch a mobile telephone handset on, an initialisation process
          starts, during which your handset is authenticated and your location registered. The initial sequence of messages may be picked
          up by other circuits such as a nearby fixed telephone handset or a public address system, and is often heard as an audible
          signal. This indicates how easy it is to couple a wireless signal into another circuit. Sensing a communication signal may
          be relatively straightforward, but separating out a particular message exchange from a multiplex of many signals will be more
          difficult, especially when, as in mobile technology, frequency hopping techniques are employed to spread the spectrum of messages
          and so avoid some common transmission problems. However, to a determined attacker with the requisite knowledge, access to
          equipment and software tools, this is all possible.
        </p>
        <p>Tapping into messages transmitted along cables without detection depends on the cable type and connection method. It is relatively
          straightforward to eavesdrop on transmitted data by positioning coupling sensors close to or in direct contact with metallic
          wires such as twisted pairs. More care would be needed with coaxial cables owing to their construction. Physical intrusion
          into physical media such as metallic wires may cause impedance changes, which in principle can be detected by time domain
          reflectometry. This technique is used to locate faults in communication media and is commonly applied to metallic cables or
          optical fibres for maintenance purposes. In practice, however, the levels of disturbance may be too slight to be measurable.
          The principle can also be applied to optical fibres.

        <p>So far I have discussed the possibilities of gaining physical access to communication networks and hence the data that is
          carried on them. However, many users are interconnected through the internet or other internetworks, and these wider networks
          (particularly the internet) offer a broad range of opportunities without the need for intruders to move away from their desks.
          Many software tools have been developed for sound, legitimate purposes. For example, <em>protocol analysers</em> (or <em>sniffers)</em> analyse network traffic and have valid use in network management activities. Network discovery utilities based on the PING
          (packet internet groper) and TRACEROUTE commands are widely included in many PC operating systems and allow IP (internet protocol)
          addresses to be probed and routes through networks to be confirmed. The very same tools, however, can be used equally effectively
          for attacks on networks. If much of the traffic on the large public networks can be intercepted by determined attackers, how
          is network security to be achieved? It is the role of encryption to hide or obfuscate the content of messages, and this is
          the subject of the next section.
