      <h2>Answer</h2>
      <p>Encryption does provide some assurance about the integrity of a message. After all, if we are confident that the message has
        been immune from eavesdropping then, with the use of an appropriate encryption scheme, we might also be reasonably confident
        that it has not been altered in any way. You should recall, though, that in the discussion about block ciphers, I said that
        they allowed specific portions of a message to be extracted and manipulated. If an attacker knew which portions of the message
        to target, it would be possible to extract one portion and substitute another. Imagine, for example, a bank that uses a block
        cipher to encrypt information about certain transactions. One block may contain details of the account to be debited, another
        the account to be credited, and another the amount to be transferred. It might not be too difficult to substitute any of these
        blocks with data that had been extracted and recorded from some earlier transaction.
