        <h2>10.1 Summary of Sections 1–5</h2>
        <p>There are many terms and abbreviations relating to this topic, and it is important to understand them.</p>
        <p>Looking at the background to network security can help to put its more technical aspects in context.</p>
        <p>Communication networks and the data they carry are vulnerable to a range of attacks. These can be categorised as either passive
          or active attacks. In a passive attack, communication across a network is observed but data within messages is not interfered
          with and messages may not even be readable by the attacker. Traffic analysis is strongly associated with passive attacks,
          but may also be a legitimate process for effective network management. An active attack typically involves, for example, the
          modification of messages or their replay, or access to data and networks through the assumption of a false identity, leading
          to either the misuse of data or disruption of network services.
        </p>
        <p>There are many opportunities for an attacker to gain physical access to networks and these need to be resisted by both electronic
          and mechanical means. The sharing of networks through, for example, the internet, provides opportunities for attack without
          the need for the attacker to be physically close to the target networks. Wireless LAN technology presents further opportunities
          for illicit network access.
        </p>
        <p>Encryption is one of the fundamental building blocks of network security. Encryption transforms plaintext into ciphertext,
          while decryption reverses the process. Encryption systems are based on one of two basic methods. The first is a symmetric
          key system in which a single secret key is shared between the two communicating entities. The second is an asymmetric system
          which uses two mathematically related keys known as the public key and the private key. One key is used for encryption and
          the other for decryption. Asymmetric key systems place higher demands on processing resources than symmetric key systems and
          tend to be slower, but they are more scalable and they do not rely on any prior secret key exchange. Hybrid systems are a
          combination of symmetric and asymmetric key systems.
        </p>
        <p>The implementation of encryption systems can be related to network protocol layers. Encryption can be applied in link layer
          or end-to-end mode. In link layer encryption, the encryption and decryption processes take place at each node along a path,
          but this can be expensive and slow. End-to-end encryption involves applying encryption at higher layers in the protocol stack.
          Network layer encryption and application layer encryption are examples. Security vulnerabilities arise when protocol header
          information is exposed during message transmission or at nodes where data is processed in unencrypted form.

        <h2>10.2 Summary of Sections 6–9</h2>
        <p>Integrity relates to assurances that a message has not been tampered with in any unauthorised way. A method of providing this
          assurance is to create a message digest, which gives a concise identity of the original message, and append it to the message.
          The message digest of the received message can then be calculated and checked for discrepancies against the digest sent. A
          message digest takes the form of a small fixed-length block of data known as a hash value. A hash value created by a one-way
          hash function is relatively easy to compute but difficult to reverse.
        </p>
        <p>Time stamps, sequence numbers and nonces are used to provide assurances about the freshness of a message and help to prevent
          replay attacks.
        </p>
        <p>Message authentication can be provided by including a digest of the message encrypted by the sender's private key. The encrypted
          digest is known as a digital signature. The recipient decrypts the digest using the sender's public key, computes a new digest
          of the received message and compares the results. A certification authority is a trusted third party that is able to validate
          public keys by issuing a digital certificate that binds the identity of the user with the key.
        </p>
        <p>The most common ways of controlling access to communication networks are restricting mechanical access and implementing password
          schemes and firewalls. Strong passwords can be generated provided that they contain no recognisable structure. Such passwords
          should be capable of withstanding, at least for a useful period of time, brute force and other computer-assisted discovery
          techniques. However, such passwords are difficult to remember and human factors become critical.
        </p>
        <p>Firewalls are implemented to control traffic at the borders of protected networks. Three approaches are based on packet-filtering
          rules (packet-filtering router), application type and content (application level gateway) and validity of transport connection
          (circuit level gateway). These approaches in varying combinations can provide firewalls appropriate to the level of perceived
          threat, but sufficiently non-restricting to legitimate users of the protected networks.
