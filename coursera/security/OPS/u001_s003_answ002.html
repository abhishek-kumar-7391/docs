      <h2>Answer</h2>
      <p>Banks have always needed secure areas such as vaults protected by security codes, locks and keys, and have been concerned
        with the authorisation and identification of staff empowered to carry out certain activities. The honesty of staff is an important
        issue and careful selection and screening procedures are needed. At the appointment stage references are usually requested
        and other checks made on potential employees, sometimes using ‘positive vetting’ procedures for sensitive appointments. In
        terms of day-to-day activities, a need-to-know policy might be followed to ensure that information is not needlessly disseminated
        within the organisation, and that sensitive paperwork such as drawings, reports and accounts is securely locked up to minimise
        risk.
      </p>
      <p>Customers, too, could present security concerns. Banks need to assess security threats arising from customer interactions,
        and government departments involved in taxation and benefits will have similar concerns. The principles behind these issues
        have not diminished in importance in the electronic environment of today's business world, although many of the ‘locks’ and
        other countermeasures take a different form.
