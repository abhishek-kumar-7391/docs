      <h2>Answer</h2>
      <p>The protocol data unit headers include addressing information; if this is obscured, it will prevent the effective routing
        of protocol data units to their destination. In a packet-switched environment each switch must be able to read the address
        information in the packet headers. Encrypting all the data including the headers of each packet at the sending node would
        render the switches at intermediate nodes unable to read the source or destination address without first decrypting the data.
