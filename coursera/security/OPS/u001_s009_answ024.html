      <h2>Answer</h2>
      <p>To avoid a dictionary attack, it is wise to ensure that strings of characters do not produce a recognisable dictionary word.
        Ensuring that each password is made up of a minimum number of characters reduces the likelihood of a successful attack over
        a given time period. Including special characters (non-alphanumeric), numbers and upper and lower case letters helps to increase
        the range of combinations that would need to be tested, and also helps to remove any recognisable structure.
