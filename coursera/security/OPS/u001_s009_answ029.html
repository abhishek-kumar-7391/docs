      <h2>Answer</h2>
      <ol class="list-decimal">
        <li>
          <p>The router could disallow all packets from the specified network by referring to the relevant IP addresses in the filtering
            rules.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>In the filtering rules TCP port 23 could be disallowed for all hosts except those with certain internal IP addresses.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>An external attack could be based on knowledge of one of the target network's internal IP addresses. However, a packet arriving
            at a network interface from an external circuit, but having an internal source IP address, would be highly suspect. This could
            be reflected in the packet-filtering rules by specifying that, for all interfaces from external circuits, packets presenting
            source addresses that are internal network IP addresses would be barred. This type of attack is termed ‘IP address spoofing’.
