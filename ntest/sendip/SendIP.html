<h1>SendIP</h1></center>

<h2>Description</h2>
<a href="http://www.earth.li/projectpurple/progs/sendip.html">SendIP</a>
is a tool which allows creating (and, of course, sending)
arbitrary IP (v4 and v6) packets. Packets may have essentially
any set of IPv6/IPv4 headers in essentially any order. A wide
variety of header types is supported, including almost all of
the defined IPv6 extension headers.
<p>
SendIP allows detailed control of all header fields, but defaults
to reasonable values for those fields you are not interested in.
As a simple command-line program, SendIP is trivially scriptable.
</p><p>
SendIP was originally written by
<a href="http://www.earth.li/projectpurple/ppl/mike.html">Mike Ricketts </a>
of <a href="http://www.earth.li/projectpurple/">Project Purple</a>. The
version distributed here is based on 2.5, with numerous additions, particularly
in the areas of IPv6 extension headers and IPsec support.

<h2>Mini-FAQ</h2>
<p><b>Q: What is SendIP good for?</b> A: SendIP allows creation of
IP packets with arbitrary contents. As such, it should be useful for
many purposes: protocol implementation testing, firewall and IDS testing,
network test gear testing, etc.
</p><p><b>Q: What is it not good for?</b> A: As SendIP works at the individual
packet level, it is less suitable for higher-level testing, e.g., testing
some new html feature. The new version of SendIP can create multiple packets,
but isn't exactly a stress testing tool - with each field being set
individually on each packet created, it limits the send rate to perhaps
some low number of thousands per second.
</p><p>Some level of stress testing can
be achieved by running multiple invocations of SendIP in parallel - 
SendIP is almost entirely CPU-bound, so if the number of invocations of it 
is limited to the number of CPU cores on the system, all can run
with almost perfect parallelism. As one example, on a 24-core system
(Intel E5-2640 CPUs at 2.50GHz), we were able to generate and send over
500,000 packets per second using 20 invocations of SendIP in parallel.
</p><p><b>Q: Which headers and protocols are supported?</b> A: 
ipv4 (including ipip, aka 4in4), ipv6 (including 6in4, 4in6 and 6in6),
icmp, icmpv6, tcp, udp, bgp, rip, ripng, ntp, ah, dest, esp, frag,
gre, hop, route, wesp. For more information, see
<a href="http://www-x.antd.nist.gov/ipv6/sendip/sendipman.html">the manual entry</a>.
</p><p><b>Q: What operating systems does SendIP run on?</b> A: The
original SendIP has support for a number of operating systems, including
various versions of FreeBSD, Solaris, and Linux. The additions here have
only been tested on Linux (specifically, recent Fedora and Ubuntu releases);
they may well work elsewhere as well, but this is totally untested.
</p><p><b>Q: How does looping work?</b> A: Normally, each invocation of
<b>sendip</b> produces exactly one packet. If, however, a <i>-l N</i>
argument is supplied, it runs <i>N</i> times, producing <i>N</i> packets.
The packets will all be identical unless one or more arguments are
either random (rN) or taken from a file (fF); see below.
</p><p><b>Q: How are string and numeric arguments handled?</b> A: Many of the header
fields, and the packet data area, can be specified via the following
syntax:
</p><ul>
<li>0xXXXX -  interpreted as a number in hex, converted to a binary
number in network byte order.
</li><li>0XXXX - interpreted as a number in octal, converted to a binary
number in network byte order.
</li><li>rN - N "random" bytes
</li><li>zN - N nul (zero) bytes
</li><li>fF - read the argument from the next line in file F
</li><li>other - taken as a literal string
</li></ul>
IPv4 addresses (and, hopefully soon, IPv6 addresses) can also be specified
with CIDR-style notation, where, e.g., 10.1.2.0/24 means "choose a
random host address out of that subnet."
<p><b>Q: How do file (fF) arguments work?</b> A: Argument values may
be stored in files; every time a file argument of the form fF appears,
the next line from file F is then read in and substituted for the
corresponding argument.
</p><p>For example, assume the file F contains the four lines:
</p><dl compact="compact">
<dt></dt><dd>
10.1.1.1
</dd><dt></dt><dd>
1000
</dd><dt></dt><dd>
10.1.1.2
</dd><dt></dt><dd>
2000
</dd></dl>
<p>

Then the arguments
</p><dl compact="compact">
<dt>
<i>-l 2 -p ipv4 -id fF p udp -ud fF</i>
</dt></dl>
<p>

would produce two UDP packets, one to 10.1.1.1:1000 and
one to 10.1.1.2:2000.
When the lines in the file are exhausted, it is rewound
and read from the beginning again. (Actually, for the sake of
efficiency, the entire file is read into memory at the start of
the program, so "rewinding" simply means moving a pointer back
to the start of the memory area.)

</p><p><b>Q: How do timestamp (tN) arguments work?</b> A: An argument
of the form tN is replaced by a <i>struct timeval</i> timestamp,
produced by a call to <i>gettimeofday()</i>, padded out with the
appropriate number of nulls. (On 64-bit systems, the timestamp
occupies 16 bytes, so this would be N-16 nulls. If N is less than
16, the timestamp is truncated.) The timestamp is in host byte
order, simply the exact binary form obtained by <i>gettimeofday()</i>.
</p><p>
If this is embedded in the data portion of a packet, the receiver
can get an idea of the end-to-end latency by comparing this value
with that produced by <i>gettimeofday()</i> on the local system - assuming,
of course, that sender and receiver clocks are sufficiently well
coordinated. A test program which demonstrates this (<b>udptimer</b>)
is included with the source.

</p><p><b>Q: What is the IPsec support?</b> A: Basic creation of AH and
ESP headers (and trailers, in the case of ESP) is supported. In
addition, external authentication and/or encryption modules may be
called, to give more realistic emulation of IPsec behavior.
</p><p>
Demonstration authentication and encryption modules are included,
which simply xor a "key" with the appropriate packet contents; these
are obviously not intended to provide any actual security, but rather
as an indication of how the module interfaces work. They should suffice
for some purposes, though, such as testing heuristics for identifying
ESP NULL packets.
</p><p><b>Q: Why is the Wrapped ESP (WESP) support "provisional"?</b> A: As of
this writing, WESP is still in draft form, with no real implementations
to compare against. So the code will quite likely need some revision when
the final RFC is issued.
</p><p><b>Q: How "alpha" is the alpha version?</b> A: Pretty alpha. Much of
the code has not been tested yet, since we are still developing the
code we were going to test it against. It compiles nicely, though.
</p><p><b>Q: Will you make RPMs for SendIP</b> A: Probably. There's already
a spec file, so it's really just a matter of housekeeping. Perhaps
when the next non-alpha version is released.
</p><p><b>Q: What is the license for SendIP?</b> A: The
<a href="http://www.earth.li/projectpurple/progs/sendip.html">original
version</a> is distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL)
version 2, and hence this version is, too. More precisely, the code
developed here, as being, in a sense, a U.S. government publication,
is technically in the public domain, but since it consists of extensions
to GPL code and is provided along with such code, in practice the GPL
applies to it as well.
