      <p>I suspect that an attacker could easily discover the identities of the parties you telephone, for example by simply telephoning
        the numbers you called. However, information about what was said in your calls may be more difficult to determine without
        an enquirer's interest becoming conspicuous. An investigation into websites that you visited, in contrast, may enable an attacker
        to build up a stronger picture of your interests and intentions based on the content of the pages, without the need to break
        cover.
