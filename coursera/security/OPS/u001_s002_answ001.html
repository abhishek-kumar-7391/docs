      <h2>Answer</h2>
      <p>Any sizeable organisation has information that needs to be kept secure, even if it is limited to details of the employees
        and the payroll. I first thought of the National Health Service and the particular responsibility to ensure patientsâ€™ medical
        records are kept secure. Academic institutions such as The Open University too must ensure that student-related information
        such as personal details and academic progress is kept confidential and cannot be altered by unauthorised people.
