      <h2>Answer</h2>
      <p>A virus attack is an active attack, but more details of the particular virus mechanism are needed for further categorisation.
        From the information on computer viruses, Trojans can lead to masquerade attacks in which captured passwords are put to use,
        and worms can result in loss of the availability of services, so denial of service is appropriate here. However, if you research
        further you should be able to find viruses that are implicated in all the forms of active attack identified in <a href="u001_s003.html#fig002">Figure 2</a>.
