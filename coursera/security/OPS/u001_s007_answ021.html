      <h2>Answer</h2>
      <p>In a packet-switched network, messages between two points could take different routes and might arrive out of sequence. It
        would be impossible for Bob to determine whether this was a result of network delays or some malicious intent. However, the
        sequence numbers would still provide a means of identifying duplicated messages.
