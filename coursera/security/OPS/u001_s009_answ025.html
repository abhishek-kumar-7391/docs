      <p>Any characteristic that is unique to a person can in principle be used to allow or bar access. For example, voice, face, hand,
        finger and iris recognition are candidates for authenticating an individual seeking access to some facility and so can be
        considered a key, like passwords. Magnetic strip cards too are often used to allow access to facilities such as workplaces,
        libraries and photocopiers.
