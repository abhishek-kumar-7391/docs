        <h2>5.1 Overview</h2>
        <p>Confidentiality between two communicating nodes is achieved by using an appropriate encryption scheme: data is encrypted at
          the sending node and decrypted at the receiving node. Encryption will also protect the traffic between the two nodes from
          eavesdropping to some extent. However, for encryption to be used effectively in networks, it is necessary to define what will
          be encrypted, where this takes place in the network, and the layers that are involved in a reference model.

        <p>The implementation of encryption in packet-switched networks must ensure that essential addressing information can be accessed
          by the relevant network devices such as switches, bridges and routers. Encryption is broadly termed <strong>link layer encryption</strong> or <strong>end-to-end encryption</strong> depending on whether it is applied and re-applied at each end of each link in a communication path, or whether it is applied
          over the whole path between end systems. It is useful to identify the various implementations of encryption with the appropriate
          OSI layer, as indicated in <a href="#fig009">Figure 9</a>.

        </div>
        <p>End-to-end encryption is implemented at or above layer 3, the network layer of the OSI reference model, while link layer encryption
          is applied at the data link and physical layers. When encryption is applied at the transport or network layers, end-to-end
          refers to hosts identified by IP (internet protocol) addresses and, in the case of TCP (transmission control protocol) connections,
          port numbers. In the context of application layer encryption, however, end-to-end is more correctly interpreted as <strong>process-to-process</strong>. <a href="#fig010">Figure 10</a> identifies the extent of encryption (unshaded areas) applied at each layer.

        <h2>5.2 Link layer encryption</h2>
        <p>Link layer encryption has been available for some time and can be applied by bulk encryptors, which encrypt all the traffic
          on a given link. Packets are encrypted when they leave a node and decrypted when they enter a node. As <a href="#fig010">Figure 10</a>(a) shows, data link layer headers are not encrypted. Because network layer information, in the form of layer headers, is
          embedded in the link data stream, link layer encryption is independent of network protocols. However, each link will typically
          use a separate key to encrypt all traffic. This makes the encryption devices specific to a given medium or interface type.
          In a large network, where many individual links may be used in a connection, traffic will need to be repeatedly encrypted
          and decrypted. One disadvantage is that while data is held at a node it will be in the clear (unencrypted) and vulnerable.
          Another is the need for a large number of keys along any path comprising many links. Hardware-based encryption devices are
          required to give high-speed performance and to ensure acceptable delays at data link layer interfaces. The effectiveness of
          link layer encryption depends on the relative security of nodes in the path, some of which may be within the internet. The
          question of who can access nodes in the internet then becomes a significant concern.
        </p>
        <p>When applied to terrestrial networks, link layer encryption creates problems of delay and expense, but it is particularly
          useful in satellite links, because of their vulnerability to eavesdropping. In this case the satellite service provider takes
          responsibility for providing encryption between any two earth stations.

          <h3>5.3.1 Network layer encryption</h3>
          <p><strong>Network layer encryption</strong> is normally implemented between specific source and destination nodes as identified, for example, by IP addresses. As <a href="#fig010">Figure 10</a>(b) indicates, the network layer headers remain unencrypted.

          <p>Network layer encryption may be applied to sections of a network rather than end-to-end; in this case the network layer packets
            are encapsulated within IP packets. A major advantage of network layer encryption is that it need not normally be concerned
            with the details of the transmission medium.
          </p>
          <p>A feature of encryption up to and including the network layer is that it is generally transparent to the user. This means
            that users may be unaware of security breaches, and a single breach could have implications for many users. This is not the
            case for application layer encryption. As with link layer encryption, delays associated with encryption and decryption processes
            need to be kept to an acceptable level, but hardware-based devices capable of carrying out these processes have become increasingly
            available.
          </p>
          <p>An important set of standards that has been introduced to provide network layer encryption, as well as other security services
            such as authentication, integrity and access control in IP networks, is IPSec from the IP Security Working Group of the Internet
            Engineering Task Force. You should refer to RFC 2401 if you need further details on these standards.

          <h3>5.3.2 Application layer encryption</h3>
          <p>In <strong>application layer encryption</strong>, end-to-end security is provided at a user level by encryption applications at client workstations and server hosts. Of necessity,
            encryption will be as close to the source, and decryption as close to the destination, as is possible. As <a href="#fig010">Figure 10</a>(c) shows, in application layer encryption only the data is encrypted.
          </p>
          <p>Examples of application layer encryption are S/MIME (secure/multipurpose internet mail extensions), S-HTTP (secure hypertext
            transfer protocol), PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) and MSP (message security protocol). Another example is SET (secure electronic
            transactions), which is used for bank card transactions over public networks. ‘Host layer encryption’ is a term sometimes
            used to refer to programs that perform encryption and decryption on behalf of the applications that access them. An example
            is secure socket layer.

        <p>An effective way of securing a network is to combine end-to-end with link layer encryption. The user data portion of a packet
          is encrypted at the host using an end-to-end encryption key. The packet is then transported across the nodes using link layer
          encryption, allowing each node to read the header information but not the user data. The user data is secure for the entire
          journey and only the packet headers are in the clear during the time the packet is processed by any node.

        <p>In considering the application of any encryption scheme, the cost in terms of network delay, increased overheads and finance
          must be weighed against the need for protection. As always, there is a need to balance the advantages of a more secure network
          against the disadvantages of implementing security measures and the potential costs of data interception and network attack.
