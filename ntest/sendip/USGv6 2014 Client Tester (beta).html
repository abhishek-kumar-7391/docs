<h1>USGv6 2014 Client Tester (beta)</h1></center>
</center>

<h2>1. Description</h2>
The <a href="http://usgv6-2014.antd.nist.gov/">USGv6 2014 Client Tester</a>
located at <b>usgv6-2014.antd.nist.gov</b>
is a set of online tools to allow you to test and demonstrate IPv6 client
functionality from client systems in your agency. The various tools in
this test suite are <i>only</i> accessible over IPv6; hence, by
connecting to them and exercising them, you can demonstrate the
sort of IPv6 client capability required by the 2014 mandate.
<p>
The tools are essentially stripped-down versions of common services
(web server, DNS server, mail server, etc.) which merely record
external accesses. Each access is tied to a key value presented by
the client; as your client system proceeds through the various tools,
its accesses can thus be correlated, and later queried, by this key.
</p><p>
Since it is client capability that is being tested, all connections
have to be initiated from your end. To facilitate this, the tester
uses some simple HTML and Javascript to prompt your client to open
the appropriate connections. <a href="http://www-x.antd.nist.gov/ipv6/usgv6-2014.tester.txt">Here
is the tester script</a>, if you wish to examine it. A more detailed
explanation of the various tests follows.

</p><p>

<h2>2. Tester appearance</h2>
<p>Here is a screenshot of the tester web frontend, running in a Google
Chrome browser. Appearance in other browsers should be very similar.

</p><h2>3. Tests performed</h2>
<h4>Automated tests</h4>
<ol>
<li><p><b>Key generation</b> Not a test per se, but the tester Javascript
generates a random 9-digit number used as a key to tie the various
test results together. You can use this key subsequently to look up
the results of your tests. Keys are only good for the day they are
generated; if you need to look up old test results, you'll have to
know the date they were run. (More or less; the lookup will also
check for two days on either side of the date you specify.)
</p></li><li><p><b>http over IPv6</b> Merely being able to connect to the tester
demonstrates this.
</p></li><li><p><b>https over IPv6</b> To demonstrate the ability to connect to
https (http over SSL/TLS) servers, the tester webpage includes a
link to a <a href="https://usgv6-2014.antd.nist.gov/WIN.jpg">small
image <img src="USGv6%202014%20Client%20Tester%20%28beta%29_files/WIN.jpg"></a> available only via https.
</p><p>Note that this beta test version
currently uses only a self-signed certificate. Many browsers
reject self-signed certificates by default. In this case, you will
see instead a red "X": <img src="USGv6%202014%20Client%20Tester%20%28beta%29_files/FAIL.jpg">. To get the test to
succeed, you will have to force your browser to accept the certificate.
By going to 
<a href="https://usgv6-2014.antd.nist.gov/selfsigned.html">this page</a>,
and accepting all the dire warnings your browser presents, you should
be able to do so.
</p></li><li><p><b>DNS lookups</b> The tester records the host name and address
presented by your browser, attempts forward and reverse DNS
lookups on them, and records the results. Note that these lookups
are being performed at the tester (server) end; they may fail if
your client system is not listed in publicly-accessible DNS.
</p></li><li><p><b>DNS over IPv6</b> Even when looking up IPv6 addresses, many
clients use IPv4 connections to speak to DNS servers. The tester
webpage includes a link to another copy of the <a href="http://usgv6-2014.usgv6.antd.nist.gov/WIN.jpg">green check image <img src="USGv6%202014%20Client%20Tester%20%28beta%29_files/WIN.jpg"></a>, in this
case from a domain (<b>usgv6.antd.nist.gov</b>)
for which there is only IPv6-based DNS service.
</p><p>In this case, if you see only a red "X" <img src="USGv6%202014%20Client%20Tester%20%28beta%29_files/FAIL.jpg">, you may
need to choose a different local DNS resolver, one capable of running
over IPv6.
</p></li><li><p><b>whois information</b> The tester attempts to look up the
publicly-available information about your client address from
<a href="http://whois.arin.net/">the ARIN Whois-RESTful web service</a>,
parses and presents the results.
</p></li></ol>
<h4>Manual tests</h4>
The tests above should all run automatically from your browser
(assuming you've done any needed setup) as soon as you hit the
"Submit Request" button. The other tests to be run
require some amount of manual intervention, such
as running a mail client or other program on your system.
<p>Hence, the tester cannot run these automatically, but it does
attempt to assist you by providing links
which may (depending on your browser) allow you to run the appropriate
clients simply by clicking on the appropriate links. Here are some
screen shots of the links the tester provides; again, click on
them for larger versions:<br>
<a href="http://www-x.antd.nist.gov/ipv6/6a.postsubmit1.png"><img src="USGv6%202014%20Client%20Tester%20%28beta%29_files/6a.png"></a>
<a href="http://www-x.antd.nist.gov/ipv6/7a.postsubmit2.png"><img src="USGv6%202014%20Client%20Tester%20%28beta%29_files/7a.png"></a>


</p><ol start="7">
<li><p><b>email connectivity </b> The tester prompts your browser to
send an email via a <b>mailto</b> link. For this test to work, your browser
must be configured to call an appropriate local email program. How to do
so depends on the browser; for Firefox, go to <i>Edit/Preferences/Applications</i>
and select the desired <i>Action</i> for the <b>mailto</b>
<i>Content Type</i>. Note that this has to be a <i>local</i> email
program; a web-based mailer like Gmail will not appear to be coming from
your client system. If your browser is appropriately configured, it
should call up your email program with the destination, subject and
mail body already set; you need merely send the email to have the
results recorded.
</p><p>
If the <b>mailto</b> method doesn't work, you can
manually run the email test as follows:
</p><ul>
<li><p>With your local email client, send email to <b>testsubmit@usgv6-2014.antd.nist.gov</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Set the Subject line to
	</p><blockquote>Key <i>&lt;your key value&gt;</i></blockquote>
where of course <i>&lt;your key value&gt;</i> should be replaced by the 9-digit numeric key that was generated for your tests.</li>
<li><p>In the body of the email, also include a line
	</p><blockquote>Key <i>&lt;your key value&gt;</i></blockquote>
with exactly the same content.</li>
<li><p>No other content in the email is required.</p></li>
</ul>
</li><li><p><b>sftp connectivity </b> The tester provides a link to fetch a
file via sftp, the ssh-based secure file transfer protocol. For this to
work, your browser must be configured to understand sftp URLs.
</p><p>
Again, if your browser does not support this, you can run the test
manually as follows:
</p><ul>
<li><p>With your local sftp client, connect to <b>testsubmit@usgv6-2014.antd.nist.gov</b>:
</p><blockquote><b>sftp testsubmit@usgv6-2014.antd.nist.gov</b></blockquote>
Use your 9-digit key as the password.
</li><li><p>You needn't transfer any files to pass the test, but if you wish,
there is a single file <b>sftptestfile.txt</b> you can fetch as an additional test.</p></li>
</ul>
</li><li><p><b>ftp connectivity </b> There is an analogous test for ftp
connectivity. Note that anonymous ftp is <i>not</i> used for this test;
instead, you again connect as user <b>testsubmit</b> using your
key value as the password.
</p><p>
In more detail (assuming your browser can't use the link provided
by the tester):
</p><ul>
<li><p>With your local ftp client, connect to <b>usgv6-2014.antd.nist.gov</b>:
</p><blockquote><b>ftp usgv6-2014.antd.nist.gov</b></blockquote>
</li><li><p>At the "Name" or "User" prompt, enter <b>testsubmit</b>
</p></li><li><p>At the "Password" prompt, enter your 9-digit key.
</p></li><li><p>Again, you needn't transfer any files to pass, but if you wish,
there is a single file <b>ftptestfile.txt</b> you can fetch as an additional test.</p></li>
</ul>
</li><li><p><b>IMAP/POP connectivity </b> There is also a test for IMAP/POP
connectivity. Unfortunately, this test can't really be automated, as it
depends on the details of your email client. Basically, you'll need to
do the following:
</p><ul>
<li><p>Add an account to your email client with username <b>testsubmit</b>
and incoming mail server <b>usgv6-2014.antd.nist.gov</b>. Choose either IMAP
or POP3 as the protocol. Outgoing server doesn't really matter.
</p></li><li><p>Again, you'll likely have to persuade your client to accept the
self-signed certificate used by the server.
</p></li><li><p>Try to fetch mail; at the "Password" prompt, enter your 9-digit key.
</p></li><li><p>There is a single (uninteresting) message you can fetch to complete
the test.
</p></li></ul>
After testing is complete, feel free to delete this account.

<h2>4. Tester results lookup</h2>
The tester collects the results of the various tests and places them
in a database. Currently, the only interface provided to this is a raw
dump of the database contents. At a later point, we will provide more
comprehensive reporting tools.
<p>
We support results lookup over both IPv4 and IPv6:
</p><ul>
<li> <a href="http://www-x.antd.nist.gov/ipv6/lookup.html">Results lookup (IPv4 accessible)</a>
</li><li> <a href="http://usgv6-2014.antd.nist.gov/lookup.html">Results lookup (IPv6 accessible only)</a>
</li></ul>

Here is an example of the retrieval screen. Again, click for a larger
