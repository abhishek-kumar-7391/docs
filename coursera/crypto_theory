The security of hashing depends on the hash function. The hash function must be computationally irreversible (one-way hash functions).
one-way hash functions : easy to compute the hash from the string, but the reverse is not possible.
Message authentication code : similar to hash function, but the algorithm uses a secret key, thus a key is required to perform the check.
Message reply attacks: record a message and then replay it at some later time in future.
