      <p>It would be tempting to believe that end-to-end encryption is the more secure method since the user data is encrypted for
        the entire journey of the data packets. However, the addressing information is transmitted in the clear and this allows, at
        the least, traffic analysis to take place.
      </p>
      <p>Much useful information can be gleaned by learning where messages come from and go to, when they occur, and for what duration
        and frequency, as described in Section 3.3.

      <p>In contrast, with a link layer encryption system the data is at risk in each node since that is where the unencrypted data
        is processed. Furthermore, link layer encryption is expensive because each node has to be equipped with the means to carry
        out encryption and decryption.
