      <h2>Answer</h2>
      <p>I thought of my cash point card and my mobile telephone. Both require me to enter a number sequence (what I know) in addition
        to possessing an artefact (the card in one case and the mobile telephone containing the SIM card in the other). (SIM stands
        for subscriber identity module.) This assumes that the user has enabled the SIM card key, although it seems that many choose
        not to.
