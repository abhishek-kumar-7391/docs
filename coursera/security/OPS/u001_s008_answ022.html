      <h2>Answer</h2>
      <p>An entity, say Charlie, could create his own digital certificate, which he claims has been issued by a certification authority
        and which allows him to masquerade as Bob. Alternatively, he could modify Bob's authentic certificate by substituting his
        own public key in place of his.
