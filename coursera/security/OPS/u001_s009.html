        <h2>9.1 Introduction</h2>
        <p>In this section I shall discuss two major approaches used to restrict access to networks – passwords and firewalls.</p>

        <h2>9.2 Passwords</h2>
        <p>I have introduced encryption keys in previous sections. A <strong>password</strong> can also be thought of as a type of key in as much as it enables the keyholder to gain access to a particular resource. In
          <a href="u001_s002.html#sec002_003">Section 2.3</a>, I described the process of starting up my computer at The Open University. I referred to the need to enter several sets
          of user identities and passwords to access various services or software using my computer. Given the frequent use of passwords,
          it is reasonable to consider what constitutes an effective password.
        </p>
        <p>A major issue here is human behaviour. It is tempting, for instance, to make a record of passwords that are used but not always
          remembered, or to make all one's passwords identical, or to make them short or highly memorable in some personal way by linking
          them to personal information, which is unlikely to be highly secure. Alternatively, names, places or normal words may be used
          as passwords. There are security concerns with all these strategies. For example, electronic dictionaries could be used to
          probe passwords that are based on known words in all languages. Where passwords are restricted to a small number of characters,
          brute force methods may quickly find the one correct combination out of many that may be possible.
        </p>
        <p>An effective password, technically speaking, is one that can resist both dictionary and brute force attacks. (For the purposes
          of network security a dictionary is a compilation of combinations of characters that find use in any field of activity. It
          is not restricted to words commonly used for general human communication.) A dictionary attack seeks to identify any predictable
          structure within the string of characters included in the password: for example, a name, a word, or a sequence of numbers,
          such as in a date format. A brute force attack relies on the power of computers to cycle through combinations of characters
          on a trial-and-error basis in the absence of predictable structure, until a successful conclusion is reached. If a password
          contains any partial structure then the processing needed to discover it is reduced.

        </div>
        <p>The security of an encrypted password used to access a remote station over a network depends on the form of encryption used
          and whether it is applied over the whole path from sender to receiver. A variety of means can be used to collect or bypass
          password protection systems. For instance, <strong>password crackers</strong> are programs specifically designed to capture password sequences, and decrypt or disable them. I referred earlier to the
          use of protocol analysers, which may be used to ‘sniff’ traffic for password sequences. In addition, Trojans can be hidden
          in programs that an attacker expects the legitimate user to run, and will contain a hidden routine to bypass the user's system's
          password protection. Hence encryption does not prevent capture and there is a danger that message replay can lead to successful
          access even when passwords cannot be decrypted by an attacker.
        </p>
        <p>Despite the problems associated with passwords, they remain a first line of defence to intruder access. There are several
          examples of internet sites offering a consolidation service for an individual's multiplicity of passwords. The idea is that
          a single encrypted password can be used to release the collection of passwords – a potential ‘winner-takes-all’ situation.

        <h2>9.3 Firewalls – an overview</h2>
        <p>Firewalls play an important role in restricting and controlling access to networks. A <strong> firewall</strong> is normally implemented within a router or gateway, and will monitor incoming and outgoing traffic at the boundary of the
          protected zone. It is a device that denies external hosts access to selected insecure services within the protected zone (e.g.
          denial of dial-in services), while also denying internal hosts access to insecure services outside the protected zone. <a href="#fig0013">Figure 13</a> shows a firewall protecting the only access to network A. There may be further control within the protected zone, for example
          to limit access from one internal LAN segment to another. A firewall provides the means to implement some of an organisation's
          network security policies and may be transparent to users of the network in terms of its presence and the level of inconvenience
          caused. This depends on the type of firewall and the policies that are implemented.

        <p>I shall now look at three different types of firewall – packet-filtering routers, application level gateways, and circuit

        <h2>9.4 Packet-filtering router</h2>
        <p>A packet-filtering router either blocks or passes packets presented to it according to a set of <strong>filtering rules</strong>. <a href="#fig014">Figure 14</a> shows this arrangement.
        </p>

          <p class="caption"> Figure 14 Packet-filtering router</p>
        </div>
        <p>Filtering rules are based on various features of the service or protocols involved, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>the packet header information, e.g. IP source and destination addresses</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>the encapsulated protocol being used, e.g. TCP or UDP, ICMP or IP tunnel (see Box 4 below)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>the transport layer source and destination ports</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>the ICMP message type</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>the incoming and outgoing interfaces for the packet.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>UDP (user datagram protocol) is a transport layer protocol in the internet reference model. It is used for traffic that does
          not need the services of a TCP connection. ICMP (internet control message protocol) is used to communicate problems from routers
          and hosts in the network. It supports, for example, the widely used PING command referred to in <a href="u001_s003.html#sec003_006">Section 3.6</a>.

              in some important security protocols that have been developed specifically for use in IP networks over the internet.

        <p>The choice of rules and the way in which they are implemented will allow a router to admit or bar specific types of user traffic.
          Services that may be called up by users at their computers are generally identified in terms of TCP or UDP port numbers. <a href="#fig015">Figure 15</a> shows where TCP port numbers are identified in the header and the box on TCP port numbers explains briefly the concept of
          TCP ports.

          <div class="box_body">
            <p>TCP is a connection-oriented protocol and provides services by creating end points called sockets at client and server machines.
              A socket uses the IP address of the host and a 16-bit port number. (A port is sometimes referred to as a transport service
              access point.) Port numbers below 1024 are reserved for standard services and are referred to as <strong>well-known ports</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>For example, Telnet is an application protocol associated with the TCP/IP family. It enables a user at one computer to log
              in to another computer, issue commands to the operating system, and run programs. A Telnet server will listen for remote connections
              on TCP port 23, while an email service based on another application protocol, SMTP (simple mail transfer protocol), will listen
              for incoming connections on TCP port 25.
            </p>
            <p>The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers">(IANA)</a> has a list of well-known ports on its website.

        <p>From the description in the box, Telnet presents a significant security risk in terms of its ability to exercise remote control
          of a workstation, server or other network device. However, Telnet can be disallowed by including its TCP port number in the
          filtering rules. Given that a TCP port number specifies a type of service and an IP address specifies a host address, you
          should be able to see how combinations of the two can be used to restrict access to certain services to certain hosts. Consider
          this further by attempting SAQ 12.

        <p>There are many types of attack that can be resisted using packet-filtering rules, but I shall consider just one other as an

        </p>
        <p><a href="#fig016">Figure 16</a> shows the structure of an IPv4 packet. The fragment offset field and the three flag bits that precede it in the packet header
          allow an IP packet to be split into two or more fragments, if it would otherwise exceed the maximum size set by the lower
          layer frame limit. However, this feature could be misused in a number of ways. For example, a fragment could be forced to
          be so small that the encapsulated packet header information would be split between fragments. Using this tactic, an attacker
          could circumvent filtering rules that checked the header information of encapsulated packets (e.g. the port identities of
          an encapsulated TCP segment as in <a href="#fig015">Figure 15</a>) only in the first fragment that is received.

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>A certain way to avoid a restricted service being accessed through the misuse of IP fragmentation would be to reject any IP
          packet in which fragmentation was allowed. In practice, when fragmentation is allowed, packet-filtering routers are usually
          set to reject IP fragments that are less than 20 bytes greater than the IP header length.
        </p>
        <p>Defining the rules under which packets are filtered demands a wide knowledge of internet service types. Filtering rules need
          to be detailed and can become complex. When packets are filtered using complex rules, the time for each packet to be processed
          by the router may increase significantly and degrade system performance. When traffic must be restricted because of its likely
          topic content, a packet-filtering approach that works on the basis of addresses (at the IP and TCP levels) will not be able
          to meet requirements. A higher layer approach is needed and this can be provided by the application level gateways that I
          shall describe next.
        </p>
        <p>Despite the limitations of packet-filtering routers, they are widely deployed as they are economical and can be implemented
          on standard routers, although additional software may need to be installed. Users behind a packet-filtering firewall generally
          find the degree of restriction involved acceptable and relatively unobtrusive.

      <div class="section" id="sec009_005">
        <h2>9.5 Application level gateways</h2>
        <p>An <strong>application level gateway</strong> is implemented through a <strong>proxy server</strong>, which acts as an intermediary between a client and a server. A client application from within the protected network may
          request services originating from less secure networks such as the internet. After the client's authentication has been confirmed,
          the requests for services are relayed onwards by the proxy server, provided that they are allowed by the security policies
          in force. All subsequent data exchanges in relation to the service request are handled by the proxy server.
        </p>
        <p>An application level gateway relays requests for services at the application level. Policy decisions to block or permit traffic
          are based on features identified in the application. For instance, electronic mail will be associated with a variety of mail
          applications and an application level gateway will act on criteria such as the message size, header fields or likely content,
          as indicated by key words. Application level gateways typically provide proxy services for email, Telnet and the World Wide
          Web.
        </p>
        <p>Normally, each supported service is rigorously defined so that any undefined services are not available to users. Each internal
          host allowed to use or provide the specified services must also be defined. The term ‘application level gateway’ is appropriate
          because, from the view of both the clients within the protected network and the remote servers, the proxy server is seen as
          the end user. The originating client and the remote server are hidden from each other.
        </p>
        <p>Because an application level gateway is exposed to greater risk than the hosts it protects, the proxy server normally takes
          the form of a specially secured host, referred to as a <strong>bastion host</strong>. This is specifically designed to be more resistant to attacks than other hosts on the protected network. For instance, a
          bastion host will run a secure version of the operating system, and may allow only essential services to be installed with
          a restricted set of Telnet, DNS, FTP and SMTP protocols. (DNS is the domain name system used on the internet to convert between
          the names of devices and their IP addresses. FTP is file transfer protocol, an application protocol in the TCP/IP family used,
          for example, to connect file servers.) In addition, a strong user authentication process is employed along with audit facilities
          that record any attempts to intrude.
        </p>
        <p>Code specifically designed to enhance regular checking for software bugs is used, and each proxy service is designed to operate
          independently of others so that installation or removal of a service can be undertaken without affecting other services. Viruses
          and worms may also be screened.
        </p>
        <p>Access to memory drives on the gateway is severely restricted to minimise threats from Trojans, and user log-on is not allowed.
          Other threats that could be countered using this type of firewall include those arising from importing macros (a software
          macro defines how a sequence of operations can be condensed into a single command), or inbound packets that include executable
          files (containing EXE or COM extensions), because of the possibility of introducing virus and worm files into a network.

        <h2>9.6 Circuit level gateways</h2>
        <p>A <strong>circuit level gateway</strong> operates at the transport layer of the OSI or internet reference models and, as the name implies, implements circuit level
          filtering rather than packet level filtering. It checks the validity of connections (i.e. circuits) at the transport layer
          (typically TCP connections) against a table of allowed connections, before a session can be opened and data exchanged. The
          rules defining a valid session prescribe, for example, the destination and source addresses and ports, the time of day, the
          protocol being used, the user and the password. Once a session is allowed, no further checks, for example at the level of
          individual packets, are performed.
        </p>
        <p>A circuit level gateway acts as a proxy and has the same advantage as an application level gateway in hiding the internal
          host from the serving host, but it incurs less processing than an application level gateway.
        </p>
        <p>Disadvantages of circuit level gateways include the absence of content filtering and the requirement for software modifications
          relating to the transport function.
        </p>
        <p>Circuit level gateways can be implemented within application level gateways or as stand-alone systems. Implementation within
          an application level gateway allows screening to be asymmetric, with a circuit level gateway in one direction and an application
          level gateway in the other.

        <h2>9.7 Examples of firewall implementation</h2>
        <p>In practice, firewalls are likely to be combinations of the types that I have described. For example, a <strong>screened sub-network</strong> is commonly incorporated in a firewall scheme, as shown in <a href="#fig017">Figure 17</a>. In this configuration an application level gateway implemented in a bastion host is used in combination with two packet-filtering
          routers. The screened sub-network that is formed is termed a <strong>demilitarised zone</strong> (DMZ). Placing servers and dial-in modems that are accessed by external users in a DMZ is a way of separating these higher-risk
          components from the protected internal network. Both external hosts and hosts within the internal network have access to services
          provided on the DMZ, but traffic across it is blocked, preventing external users from gaining direct access to the protected
          internal network.

        </div>
        <p>To end this unit I shall very briefly indicate the way in which the Open University's network is protected by its firewall.</p>
        <p><a href="#fig018">Figure 18</a> represents the Open University's firewall arrangement, which needs to accommodate the diverse networking needs of many people:
          for example, students, administrators, academics, whether on site or working from remote sites such as conference venues,
          home or summer school locations. The Open University has its headquarters at Walton Hall, Milton Keynes. Thirteen regional
          centres and warehousing facilities each have LANs linked to the Walton Hall LAN to create the Open University's wide area
          network.
        </p>

          <div><span><img src="assets/t823_1_018i.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
          <p class="caption"> Figure 18 The Open University firewall</p>
        </div>
        <p><a href="#fig018">Figure 18</a> shows the firewall protecting the Walton Hall / internet interface. The services that students need to access are located
          within the DMZs. Students typically connect from their homes using dial-up modems or ADSL links to access the internet through
          their internet service providers, or they gain access from their workplaces. Web browsers are used to access services such
          as the library, the main web server or student services, and electronic conferencing software is used to access the servers
          that support the various course conferences.
        </p>
        <p>In general, the firewall allows traffic to and from the DMZs but only traffic that can be identified as being initiated by
          internal users on the Open University's LANs is permitted to cross the firewall.
        </p>
        <p>An additional feature of the Open University's arrangements allows authorised staff access to appropriate areas of the Walton
          Hall LAN from external locations. To do this a virtual private network (VPN) provides a logical bypass to the firewall, but
          access is secured by the use of ‘one-time’ password generators in ‘key fobs’ allocated to authorised users. These generate
          a frequent supply of different passwords. Before any request for services using the VPN is granted, the user requesting the
          service must respond with a valid password to a challenge from the VPN security system.
