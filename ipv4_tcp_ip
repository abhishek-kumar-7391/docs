headerlen = 20 bytes unless options are present, max 60 bytes since the header len is 4 bit field.

The header checksum is calculated over the IP header only. It does not cover any data that follows
the header. ICMP, IGMP, UDP, and TCP all have a checksum in their own headers to cover their
header and data.
If any packet is discarded due to the checksum errors, then it is upto the higher layer protocols
to detect missing and retransmit. IP does not do anything in that regard.
ICMP, IGMP, UDP, and TCP all use the same checksum algorithm, although TCP and UDP
include various fields from the IP header, in addition to their own header and data.
Checksum implementation : RFC 1071 [Braden, Borman, and Partridge 1988]

IP can receive a datagram from TCP, UDP, ICMP, or IGMP (that is, a
locally generated datagram) to send, or one that has been received from a network interface (a
datagram to forward).

Advantages of Subnetting : -> reduces the size of the routing tables.
