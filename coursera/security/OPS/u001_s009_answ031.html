      <h2>Answer</h2>
      <p>An application level gateway is more demanding in terms of the necessary hardware and software because of the burden of acting
        as a proxy. It is therefore likely to be more expensive than packet filtering and also to incur longer processing delays.
        The enforcement of strict policies may also be seen as restricting the options of users behind the firewall or of legitimate
        ones outside. This type of firewall is less user-friendly and less transparent than a packet-filtering firewall.
